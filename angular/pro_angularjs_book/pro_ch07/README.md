Pro AngularJS - Chapter 7 "SportsStore: Navigation and Checkout"

Chapter 7: Added navigation and checkout
- obtained the product data from the Deployd server
- added support for working with partial views
- implementd a custom directive
- set up URL routing
- added functionality for placing an order

Chapter 6: Started SportsStore application development with:
- temporarily defining fake product data
- filtering/displaying products by category
- added some very basic pagination

TO RUN:
1. cd into directory containing this README
2. Get Deployd server up by running this command: dpd -p 5500 sportsstore/app.dpd
3. Start Node server by running this command: node server.js
4. Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000/app.html

Notes:
- Deployd was used to manage the product data
- Normally one probably wouldn't include this in git...but for now, hard coding the product data and including Deployd files
